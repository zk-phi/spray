** Installation

Put cedit.el into a "load-path"ed directory, and load it in your init
file.

: (require 'spray)

Then you can start spraying from the cursor position with =M-x
spray-mode=. Binding some keys may also be useful.

: (global-set-key (kbd "<f6>") 'spray-mode)

** Commands

In spray-mode buffers, following commands are available.

- =spray-start/stop= (SPC) ::
     pause or resume spraying

- =spray-backward-word= (h, <left>) ::
     pause and back to the last word

- =spray-forward-word= (l, <right>) ::
     inverse of =spray-backward-word=

- =spray-faster= (f) ::
     increases speed

- =spray-slower= (s) ::
     decreases speed

Press any key else to quit =spray-mode=.

You may customize spray by modifying following items:

- [Variable] spray-wpm
- [Variable] spray-height
- [Keymap] spray-mode-map
